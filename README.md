# SafeSpace

Our app allows users to pair with a walking buddy to get safely from point A to point B. For example, imagine you are a woman at a bar, alone, late at night. You would likely feel unsafe walking back home, or to the bus stop yourself. This is where SafeSpace comes in. SafeSpace allows you to find walking buddies in your area to get to point A to B. All walking buddies have an extensive background check, and a star rating system to ensure trustworthiness and the safety of the users.
